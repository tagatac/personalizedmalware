@inproceedings{Salem2011,
abstract = {Masquerade attacks are a common security problem that is a consequence of identity theft. This paper extends prior work by modeling user search behavior to detect deviations indicating a masquerade attack. We hypothesize that each individual user knows their own file system well enough to search in a limited, targeted and unique fashion in order to find information germane to their current task. Masqueraders, on the other hand, will likely not know the file system and layout of another users desktop, and would likely search more extensively and broadly in a manner that is different than the victim user being impersonated. We identify actions linked to search and information access activities, and use them to build user models. The experimental results show that modeling search behavior reliably detects all masqueraders with a very low false positive rate of 1.1\%, far better than prior published results. The limited set of features used for search behavior modeling also results in large performance gains over the same modeling techniques that use larger sets of features.},

abstract = {Masquerade attacks pose a grave security problem that is a consequence of identity theft. Detecting masqueraders is very hard. Prior work has focused on profiling legitimate user behavior and detecting devi- ations from that normal behavior that could potentially signal an ongoing masquerade attack. Such approaches suffer from high false positive rates. Other work investigated the use of trap-based mechanisms as a means for detecting insider attacks in general. In this paper, we investigate the use of such trap-based mechanisms for the detection of masquerade at- tacks. We evaluate the desirable properties of decoys deployed within a user’s file space for detection.We investigate the trade-offs between these properties through two user studies, and propose recommendations for effective masquerade detection using decoy documents based on findings from our user studies.},

@article{Razo-Zapata2012,
abstract = {This paper presents a set of methods for building masquerade attacks. Each method takes into account the profile of the user to be impersonated, thus capturing an intruder strategy. Knowledge about user behavior is extracted from several statistics, including the frequency at which a user types a specific group of commands. It is then expressed by rules, which are applied to synthesize computer sessions that mimic the attack as ordinary user behavior. The masquerade attack datasets have been validated by making a set of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) try to detect user impersonation, this way showing the capabilities of each masquerade synthesis method for evading detection. Results demonstrate that a better performance of masquerade attacks can be obtained by using methods based on behavioral rules rather than those based only on a single statistic. Summing up, masquerade attacks exhibit a good strategy for bypassing an IDS. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Wagner2002,
abstract = {We examine several host-based anomaly detection systems and study their security against evasion attacks. First, we introduce the notion of a mimicry attack, which allows a sophisticated attacker to cloak their intrusion to avoid detection by the IDS. Then, we develop a theoretical framework for evaluating the security of an IDS against mimicry attacks. We show how to break the security of one published IDS with these methods, and we experimentally confirm the power of mimicry attacks by giving a worked example of an attack on a concrete IDS implementation. We conclude with a call for further research on intrusion detection from both attacker's and defender's viewpoints.},

@article{Schechter2009,
abstract = {All four of the most popular webmail providers - AOL, Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo! - rely on personal questions as the secondary authentication secrets used to reset account passwords. The security of these questions has received limited formal scrutiny, almost all of which predates webmail. We ran a user study to measure the reliability and security of the questions used by all four webmail providers. We asked participants to answer these questions and then asked their acquaintances to guess their answers. Acquaintances with whom participants reported being unwilling to share their webmail passwords were able to guess 17\% of their answers. Participants forgot 20\% of their own answers within six months. What's more, 13\% of answers could be guessed within five attempts by guessing the most popular answers of other participants, though this weakness is partially attributable to the geographic homogeneity of our participant pool.},
